# paddle-billing-python-sdk
A *limited* Python wrapper for the new Paddle Billing SDK

This project only contains the Paddle Billing components needed to satisfy another project of mine. Please feel free to contribute missing components. I may or may not add additional components myself over time, no promises. I am always open to PRs for bug fixes or new features.
