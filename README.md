# paddle-billing-python-sdk
A limited Python wrapper for the new Paddle Billing SDK

This project only contains the Paddle Billing components needed to satisfy another project of mine. Please feel free to contribute missing components. I may or may not add additional components myself over time, no promises. I am always open to PRs for bug fixes or new features.
